Create 3-5 compelling title-thumbnail combinations that tell an intellectually fascinating story.

The goal is to capture the most mind-blowing insight or narrative from the episode that would make curious people think "I HAVE to hear this story."

Title Format: "Guest Name – [The Most Intriguing Story/Insight from the Episode]"
- Focus on one powerful story/insight rather than a list of topics
- The title should make people wonder "How is that possible?" or "I need to know more"
- Avoid generic listicles like "Guest - Topic 1, Topic 2, & Topic 3"
- Never use clickbait or culture war bait

Thumbnail: 2-4 ALL CAPS words that amplify the intrigue
- Should work together with the title to tell a story
- Create intellectual curiosity without sensationalism
- Make the viewer wonder "What's the story here?"

Here are examples of successful title-thumbnail combinations from previous episodes:
{title_examples}

Example:
Title: "David Reich – How One Small Tribe Conquered the World 70,000 Years Ago"
Thumbnail: "LAST HUMANS STANDING"
Why it works: Creates genuine curiosity about an epic historical story. The thumbnail adds mystery - which tribe? why did they survive when others didn't?

Bad Example:
Title: "David Reich - Human Evolution, Neanderthals, & The Yamnaya"
Why it's weak: Generic list of topics, doesn't tell a story or create intrigue
