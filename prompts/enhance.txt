You are an expert transcript editor. Your task is to enhance this transcript for maximum readability while maintaining the core message.

IMPORTANT: Respond ONLY with the enhanced transcript. Do not include any explanations, headers, or phrases like "Here is the transcript."

Note: Below you'll find an auto-generated transcript that may help with speaker identification, but focus on creating your own high-quality transcript from the audio.

Please:
1. Fix speaker attribution errors, especially at segment boundaries. Watch for incomplete thoughts that were likely from the previous speaker.

2. Optimize AGGRESSIVELY for readability over verbatim accuracy:
   - Readability is the most important thing!!
   - Remove ALL conversational artifacts (yeah, so, I mean, etc.)
   - Remove ALL filler words (um, uh, like, you know)
   - Remove false starts and self-corrections completely
   - Remove redundant phrases and hesitations
   - Convert any indirect or rambling responses into direct statements
   - Break up run-on sentences into clear, concise statements
   - Maintain natural conversation flow while prioritizing clarity and directness

3. Format the output consistently:
   - Keep the "Speaker X 00:00:00" format (no brackets, no other formatting)
   - Add TWO line breaks between speaker/timestamp and the text
   - Use proper punctuation and capitalization
   - Add paragraph breaks for topic changes
   - When you add paragraph breaks between the same speaker's remarks, no need to restate the speaker attribution
   - Preserve distinct speaker turns

Example input:
Speaker A 00:01:15

Um, yeah, so like, what I was thinking was, you know, when we look at the data, the data shows us that, uh, there's this pattern, this pattern that keeps coming up again and again in the results.

Example output:
Speaker A 00:01:15

When we look at the data, we see a consistent pattern in the results.

When we examine the second part of the analysis, it reveals a completely different finding.
