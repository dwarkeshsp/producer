"Episode w @dylan522p and @asianometry out!

A bonanza on how the semiconductor industry actually works.

& what Xi could do if he becomes scaling pilled, how we can train models with 10,000x GPT-4's compute by end of decade, & much more.

This one is very fun. Enjoy! Links below.",https://x.com/dwarkesh_sp/status/1841494962824945718
"I had no idea how wild the story of human evolution was before chatting with the geneticist of ancient DNA David Reich.

Human history has been again and again a story of one group figuring ‘something’ out, and then basically wiping everyone else out.

From the tribe of 1k-10k modern humans 70,000 years ago who killed off all the other human species; to the Yamnaya horse nomads 5,000 years ago who killed off 90+% of (then) Europeans and also destroyed the Indus Valley Civilization.

So much of what we thought we knew about human history is turning out to be wrong, from the ‘Out of Africa’ theory to the evolution of language, and this is all thanks to the research from David Reich’s lab.

Extremely fascinating stuff.
