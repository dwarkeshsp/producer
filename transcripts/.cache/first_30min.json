It also probably depends on us. It's probably in our hands, depending on how the unknown physics breaks out. Our idea of the answer to that question has changed quite a lot over the last century. About, like in the 1930s when they turned on the big telescopes, they discovered that the universe was expanding, which is something that they were not previously aware. And the question is, how fast is it expanding? And then in the 1990s, we discovered something that really surprised us, which is that there had been a learned debate up to that point about whether it was expanding so slowly that it would just expand and then recollapse in a big crunch, or whether it was expanding sufficiently fast that would just kind of keep going forever, maybe slowing down in its expansion, but not. Not growing forever. And then in possibly the worst day in human history in terms of expected value in the 90s, we discovered something that had not been anticipated, which is that not only is it expanding, but the rate at which it's expanding is accelerating. It's getting faster and faster and faster as it expands, what's called a cosmological constant or dark energy. And that completely changes the answer to the question. Question, what is the ultimate fate if it's really there? Because it means that distant galaxies, galaxies that are more than maybe 20 billion light years away from us right now, are being dragged away from us by the expansion of the universe. And we'll never reach them. We'll never get to them, because even if we headed towards them at the speed of light, the expansion of the universe is dragging them away faster than we'll be able to catch up with them. And that's really bad news. That's really bad news because we have plans for those galaxies. You know, maybe we go get them and turn them into tropical idols or computronium or whatever we had a plan for. And we can't if the cosmological constant is really there, because they're being dragged away from us by the expansion of the universe. So how confident of that picture should we be is your question. Yeah. So in answer to your question, according to that picture, eventually the ultimate fate will just be that these universe gets dragged away. Only the universes that are currently within a dozen light years of us, only the galaxies that are currently within a dozen light years of us will be able to reach.",

But that anything that's beyond that, it's just going to be dragged away from us by the cosmological constant. And so that's just a finite number of galaxies and a finite amount of resources. But then you ask, how confident should we be? And I think on first principles grounds, you should be not particularly confident in that answer at all. We've had a number of radical reimaginings of what the expansion and fate of the universe is in the last century and including in my lifetime. And so just on first principles grounds, you might imagine that you shouldn't be very confident, and indeed you shouldn't. We're not totally confident that the dark energy that currently seems to be pushing the universe apart is indeed going to be a feature of our universe forever. And things could change a lot, including, you could imagine that a future civilization could manipulate the cosmological constant and bleed it away or manipulate it in some way in order to avoid the heat death, basically.",

But it does seem to be a feature of our best theories, a completely untested feature, but a feature nevertheless of our best theories that combine quantum mechanics and gravity. That the cosmic constant isn't just some fixed value, that in fact it can take different values, the amount of dark energy, the energy density and dark energy in what's called different vacuums. So for example, string theory has this property that there are many, many vacuums, if string theory is correct, in which the cosmological constant can take very different values. And that perhaps provides some hope for us, because if the cosmological constant is completely fixed, there is just a finite amount of free energy in our future light cone, and eventually we will use it all up and then we will be out of luck. We'll just be in a heat death scenario. And that's very bad news for Our future descendants and their happiness. If we want to survive forever as a civilization, and we would like an unbounded amount of free energy. And we could do that if we could take the cosmological constant from its current value down to a much smaller value, asymptotically approaching zero. And then you could hope that you could have an unlimited amount of free energy in our future lake cone. That's. I mean, this is obviously speculative, but it does, nevertheless, it's a natural possibility raised by our best theories. And what you'd have to do is you'd have to, you know, build apparatus to lower the value of the cosmological constant. I think maybe an analogy would be cloud seeding, for example, where you have water. In clouds, the water would all things. It's in a gaseous phase in clouds. All things considered, it would like to be rain. It would have, like, a lower energy if it was rain. But it has a trouble getting from where it is to where it wants to be. And by humans going in and taking actions, they can influence it to be in a phase of lower energy for their purposes. So I think that'll be the analogy here.",

There is this idea that there are many other potential places the universe could have ended up in some abstract space of cosmological constants and laws of physics. And most of those places it could end up, I mean, the overwhelming majority of them are extremely inhospitable to life as we know it, or possibly any kind of life. If the cosmological constant goes negative, then the whole universe will just, over the course of time, collapse to a singularity, which would be bad for life as we know it. Even if you arrange that the cosmological constant goes down by a small amount into some other vacuum, typically all the other constants of nature adjust. So they would change. For example, the electromagnetic constant that we know about, that galvans, the strength of the electromagnetic force would change. And that would be very bad for us because evolution has really honed us to be very, very good with this value of the electromagnetic constant, or the constant that controls the strong nuclear force or the weak nuclear force, and be very, very bad. When that's not true. So if we were to do it, we'd have to be very careful as we did it. Because if you change the. You have to choose somewhere that's compatible with everything else that is required for life. If you change the strong nuclear force even a tiny bit. This is something that sort of puzzled people years ago. It looks like it's got a very. And suddenly protons are unstable and decay into neutrons rather than vice versa. And everything you think you know about nuclear physics or the stability of matter gets disrupted. So you have to be very, very careful while you're doing it to only affect the cosmological constant and have be in firm control of all of the other effects it has.",

And you would have something that looks like a particle collider, but that would probably have to have considerably more control than a particle collider in order to affect the transition to the vacuum you want and not any other vacuum. And then the actual bubble of new. If you make a bubble of new vacuum and it's too small, the surface tension beats the fact that there's an interior effect where it wants to be the new vacuum, and an exterior effect where there's a surface tension that just wants to make it collapse again. And if it's too small, the surface area to volume ratio is too small and it'll just collapse down again. So you need to make a sufficiently large bubble in order to affect this change.

So in such a world, you might imagine that there might be decentralization would not be impossible. Like a libertarian fantasy of the future is just not possible in a world in which there are such ginormous negative externalities. So I think that there is a question for our very future distant descendants of whether they will be able to live in a decentralized libertarian world in which just different galaxies don't need to necessarily coordinate will depend in part on what is possible or not possible according to the laws of physics. You could even imagine a really negative scenario in which for some reason you could have some speculative physics theories in which you could imagine that there would be power plants that people might be tempted to make that would be super efficient power plants, but would have a tiny risk of destabilising the vacuum in a negative way, not the sort of positive future I've described, but in which most destabilizations of the vacuum are very negative.

So if you ask me, you know, 99% of the matter in the solar system lives in the sun or on Jupiter, and yet we leave seems to live in this like, really weird corner of the solar system. Why is that? I'm pretty confident that the answer to that is anthropic, that if we lived in the center of the sun, we'd be dead. And so one should expect intelligent life to live in this weird place in parameter space. So that's perhaps my most confident answer to that question. Why do we live where we live? Then if we start talking about different concepts of nature, we start getting different answers to that question. Why is the universe tuned such that the proton is just a tiny bit more stable than the neutron? That seems like that's begging for an anthropic answer. Of course, if that's true, that demands that there be different places somewhere in the multiverse where in fact, the neutron is slightly heavier than the protons, decay to neutrons, rather than vice versa, and people just don't live there. So if you want to go down that road, you end up being naturally drawn to the existence of these variables. Scanning over space, is there some way.",

That seems the standard model was just fine before we discovered that the neutrinos have mass in the 1990s. And those just seem to be just totally kind of out of nowhere. Who ordered that? A famous Nobel Prize winning physicist said about the muon. In fact, longer ago than that, they just seem to be there, but without any particular reason.

This what's sometimes called the echo of the big bang and the inhomogeneities in it, the fact that it's not quite the same in every direction. And doing that discovered like a super interesting fact that was definitely not known in my lifetime anyway, which is the quantum origin of all of the structure we see in the universe. So if you look out in the universe, the density is not the same everywhere. The density on earth is much more than an interplanetary space, which is itself much more than an intergalactic space. And the center of the sun is all the more denser. It is inhomogeneous. It is not the same. And if you look back to the early universe, it was considerably more homogeneous. It was homogeneous to 1 part in 10 to the 5 or 10 to the 6th super almost everywhere. Every point had almost exactly the same density. And so then there's kind of an easy part and a hard part. The easy part is understanding how if you have very small inhomogeneities, how they grow into large inhomogeneities, that's already quite well understood by classical physics. Basically, the idea is this. If you have a place that's denser and a place that's less dense, then the gravitational force pulls stuff towards the high density stuff. So if you have a small inhomogeneity, they naturally grow under that effect, where they just gravitationally fall towards the denser thing. If you start seeded with small inhomogeneities, that will grow large inhomogeneities. And that's well understood. The thing that we now understand much better than we did is where those small inhomogeneities come from. Like why just after the Big bang, was the universe not perfectly homogeneous? Because if it was perfectly homogeneous, there's no opportunity for anything to grow. And we now understand with a high degree of confidence something that we didn't understand, which is that those inhomogeneities were seeded by quantum fluctuations. That when the universe, just after the big bang was considerably smaller than it is today, the effects of quantum mechanics were correspondingly more important. And those quantum fluctuations produced tiny little fluctuations in the density of matter in the universe. And all of those tiny little one part in a million fluctuations grew into all of the structure you see in the universe, all the galaxies you me everything else.",
